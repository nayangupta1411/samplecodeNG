Queue is a data structure in which the elements are added at one end, called the rear, and deleted from the other end, called the front.
It is a First In First Out data structure (FIFO). The rear of the queue is accessed whenever a new element is added to the queue, 
and the front of the queue is accessed whenever an element is deleted from the queue. There are two basic operations which can be 
implemented on the linked queues. The operations are Insertion and Deletion.
There can be the two scenario of insertion into the linked queue.In the first scenario, we insert element into an empty queue. 
In the second case, the queue contains more than one element. With each insertion the position of REAR is incremented by 
1. In linked list implementation of a queue a new element is always added at the tail of the list and d-eleted from the 
head of the linked list.  The essential condition which is checked before insertion in a linked queue is overflow.
Deletion operation removes the element that is first inserted among all the queue elements. There are again two cases that 
whether the list is empty or the list contains some elements. With each deletion the position of FRONT is incremented by 1.
