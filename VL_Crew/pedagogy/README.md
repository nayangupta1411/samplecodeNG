#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :     <u> Expository and problem based.</u>
###### Assessment Method: <u>Formative Assessment</u>

<u> <b>Description: </b> In this experiment you will learn about the mechanism of insertion and deletion in queue ADT </u>
<br>
 <div align="justify"> 
<br>
•	The student will decide the aim<br>
•	He will read the manual .<br>
•	The student will then be asked a set of pre assessment questions <br>
•       The student will perform the experiment with the help of simulator <br>
•       At last the student will be asked a set of post assessment questions <br>

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment.
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Recall | He will study the theory and will be given a question on queue | <div align="justify"> What is datatype of a queue?<br> a) Abstract        b) Integer         <br> c)Float                     d) Double
2.| Learn | He will click the enqueue button | <div align="justify">The essential condition that is <br> checked before insertion in a <br> queue is?<br> a) Underflow    b) Overflow<br> c) Rear value     d) Front value
3.| Acquire | He will click the dequeue button |<div align="justify"> The essential condition that is <br> checked before deletion from a <br> queue is? <br> a) Underflow    b) Overflow <br> c) Rear value     d) Front value

#### 5. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr. No |  What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| The student will take elements for input in a queue. | Simulator will store the values of the elements| <div align="justify"> Student will be able to make a queue
2.| The student will click the insertion button. | Simulator will perform the  <br> insertion operation | <div align="justify"> Student will learn how <br> insertion is carried out in a <br> queue
3.| The student will click the deletion button.  | Simulator will perform the <br> deletion operation | <div align="justify"> Student will acquire <br> knowledge about the  <br> deletion operation in a <br> queue.
